# Mediate

Mediate is the world's most awesome media aggregator. You have been tasked to build it for a cohort of demanding clients that want to scan the world's TV, Movie, Photo and Music APIs to find the best content.

That's a lot of APIs!  You'll need to sign up for them, pay for them, mock certain calls for testing, create various sandbox accounts... Ahh!

Or you could just use unmock :-)

Here are some of the media APIs unmock currently mocks:

| API | Description |
=====================
| TVMaze | TV Shows |
| Flickr | Photos |
| Rotten Tomatos | Movie Reviews |
| Spotify | Music |

Oh yeah, we almost forgot... you're going to need to aggregate some usage information and send to to some APIs.

Again, unmock to the rescue.
